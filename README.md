# Command Line Interface Application for Interaction with Embedded Devices

## CLI Application Introduction
The CLI application is a Python based utility that enables users to communicate with an embedded device such as a microcontroller or a microprocessor. With minimal prerequisites and configurations, this tool allows the users to begin communication to the embedded device for device configuration, control or firmware updates.

#### Prerequisites
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10.2 or higher
+ Embedded device connected to the PC and capable of UART communication
	
### Embedded Firmware
+ The CLI application was tested using [ATmega4809 Curiosity Nano Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/DM320115).
+ The firmware programmed on the board for communicating with the CLI application is available in [CLI Firmware ATmega4809](https://github.com/MMMRepos/cli-firmware.git).

### Running the CLI Application
The CLI application can be invoked from a terminal or command prompt as follows:
1. Open a command prompt on your system
2. In the command prompt, navigate to the folder on your system where this repository is cloned
3. Type cli.py and press enter to start the CLI application
4. Refer to the [Demo](#demo) section for viewing the CLI application in action.
